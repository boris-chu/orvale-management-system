My Work History

As an Information Technology Technical Support Analyst I (ITTSA), I am part of a group of about nine or ten ITTSAs at a time. Our team analyzes and documents information via a ticketing system (Cherwell) and respond to users for various issues every day ranging from the mundane to complicated system issues, sometimes require computer or network security assessments if the Departmental Information Security Office is involved. I typically assume the leadership role, and this tendency extends to every place I find myself in. I aim to showcase my multidisciplinary abilities and lead others while providing comprehensive technology support, adhering to the highest quality standards. I firmly believe that this will equip me for a more advanced and impactful role in the future.

I've assisted with numerous projects and helped many users with various IT-related issues. One significant project involved the procurement of and replacement of network-based Managed Printer Services (MPS) printers. The previous contract with Xerox, which was providing services for the Department of Public Social Services, had expired, and Sharp / Lexmark won the bid for the installation and service of their managed printer systems. I played a crucial role in supervising the rollout and configuration of more than 100 new printers, collaborating closely with Sharp and Lexmark vendors to ensure complete installation and network connectivity with the servers.

Another project I was involved in was the installation and update of firmware of docking stations and the removal of desktop computers / workstations for over 100 users in five commercial buildings at Crossroads DPSS headquarters.  This process required careful consideration of data backup, including documents, files, bookmarks, and shared mailboxes. I personally visited each location to remove PC workstations, which were then sent back to the DPSS warehouse for assessment, either for obsolescence or refurbishment and shipment to a different office. In cases where there were no master keys, bolt cutters were employed to remove locks.

Most recently, I worked with users to replace their current three-five year old laptops. This was the Laptop Refresh project. During this refresh, I ensured that all the users data was backed up to the cloud as well as their respective county share drives as well as synced their bookmarks. After that was completed, I would ensure that the new laptop worked with their current applications. Reinstalling different applications and printers as well as connecting back to the network with their data. Users were up and running within an hour and this is for more than 30 users in the building but this project is ongoing and there are over 100 users for multiple sites, combined is roughly 150 users.

I also engaged in meetings with the Departmental Informational Security Officer II to discuss the use of SharePoint and OneDrive and meet compliance of departmental procedures, with a focus on enhancing network security when transitioning from County Share Drives. This also involved integration testing, before the full implementation was involved in creating this new process that would change how the department operates its share drives. Additionally, I assisted with submitting requests for Internet Content Filtering approval for required websites used by employees.

I actively contributed to the continuous improvement of information systems infrastructure for the Customer Service Centers (CSC), helping with their applications and user acceptance testing (UAT) or feasibility studies as well as maintenance. Also, in the event of file deletions related to SharePoint or OneDrive, I helped restore them. For documents or files deleted from file servers or the “County Share Drive”, I submitted requests to restore the previous day's backup. I also diagnosed and resolved issues with users over the phone, providing technical guidance in layman-friendly terms. Moreover, I often troubleshoot issues typically managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), often resolving problems more quickly than users experienced with their own Internet Service Providers.

Other responsibilities include diagnostics of the malfunction of laptop batteries. I would perform a replacement of the battery pack when it gets delivered. 

I also assisted in leading the deployment of new managed iPhones after the mobile contract transitioned from Verizon to T-Mobile, and configure the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses for LA County DPSS Wireless Access Points, allowing users to access Wi-Fi at DPSS county buildings.

In cases where a user's phone was disconnected from mobile device management (MDM) by Microsoft Intune, I troubleshoot and restore network configuration and access to ensure the security of organizational data. I also played a role in setting up meetings for executive staff and coordinates audio-video setups for effective hybrid communication, including using Microsoft Teams with Polycom systems. Troubleshooting microphone systems and managing microphone maintenance were also part of my responsibilities.

At DPSS Academy, I assisted instructors in setting up classroom settings for Microsoft Teams, diagnosing and resolving issues with classroom Polycom cameras, and ensuring proper camera configuration. For laptops that were beyond repair, I ordered replacements and set them up for users. Additionally, I managed requests for deactivation of Verizon Bills and also deactivate user accounts for broadband services no longer in use or for end-users who recently retired.

I am proficient in conducting in-depth assessments of complex systems analysis to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. I excel in gathering, interpreting, and documenting user requirements and business processes, utilizing a range of methodologies and tools to ensure comprehensive understanding and accuracy. I aided users in adding extra monitors and setting them up for use. 

I submit tickets to Cherwell in regard to CalSAWS and financial related programs such as Oracle database issues that would subsequently directed to Information Systems Analysis or Program Application Developers for assistance.

I completed training for the Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) for the California Statewide Automated Welfare System (CalSAWS) and assisted users with activating Microsoft 365 products. User instructions or user manual for resetting Cisco Voice over IP (VoIP) phones and addressing various IT-related issues were also within my purview.

Troubleshooting Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) issues with the Internal Services Department (ISD) and helping users with installation of software like Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Office, and legacy applications were part of my daily tasks. I assist users with password resets and install software for VPN are also common requests, especially for remote network support. Sometimes users will require the use of Cisco Jabber, or other software that we do not support, in that case, we provide a user manual or create a guide for them to use. All guides I create, I would provide to the team for everyone’s use.

I collaborated with In-Home Supportive Services Social Workers on Salesforce web business applications and Amazon Connect used in a call center environment, helping diagnose and address audio issues. I also helped with diagnosing issues Amazon Appstream, service that has virtual servers for users to login to the LA County network before removing into their own office Desktop. I conduct weekly maintenance of McAfee and Microsoft BitLocker management was essential for maintaining information security, as was dealing with malware-infected emails and perform scans.

I also worked with the Principal Network Systems Administrator to determine the configuration of the Public Internet Access (PIA) computers on the Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) in the lobby and interview rooms at the Bureau of Human Resources. We worked together in ensuring the software deployment was implemented correctly and reconnected computers with trust relationship issues to the LA County PIA network, other times, it was a to reconfigure and install software following the departmental procedures and connecting them to the normal LA County network.

I’ve helped Risk Management and Safety section with the setting up SharePoint and OneDrive for efficient document collaboration among teams according to their technical specifications performing user testing to ensure the software performs as expected.

I volunteered at the DPSS warehouse to refurbish desktop computers and deploy new laptops. We used a router with multiple ports to connect multiple computers at once. This included OS installation of the Windows operating system (OS) for multiple laptops at once and reinstallation or reformat / reconfigure for warrantied desktop workstations, installing virus protection and ensured the System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) was installed which is part of the network security solutions. I securely wiped data from obsolete computers and helped with adding shared mailboxes for users. I also created PDF guides for various computer tasks and assisted in getting websites whitelisted for LA County firewalls, namely zscaler.

Using the IDE, Visual Studio Code and occasionally Thonny, I contributed to the development of an application using Python-based programming tailored for our team in technical support services. Presently in its beta testing phase, the program was disseminated to a group of beta testers for assessment of its utility. Given my inclination and analytical skills with debugging software applications, I have been extensively engaged in testing and rectifying issues to achieve a working program design, however, there was concerns that it may be easier if the program was designed web. I always consider a security assessment of risk when running any code that I generate or research how to run the application with Flask.

I help users with Windows update to the latest version, routinely reconfigure with new OS installations that fall off domain due to trust relationship errors. I update BIOS settings as well as firmware for laptops and/or docking stations. I also patch new lines on Cisco Catalyst switches and help locate networking equipment for asset tagging or when a cubicle / user required an extra network ethernet port. Another task I would assist with is, the cooling down of server rooms by providing external ventilation. This required me to relocate some industrial fans from another building when necessary during these hot periods to ensure network performance is still adequate. Eventually the air conditioning / HVAC system will be restored, but when it is not functioning, we will follow the recovery plan or disaster recovery plan. 

I ensured the reliability of the network by overseeing hardware upgrades or replacements, especially for networking equipment. Scanning equipment for user assignments or removals was part of the inventory management process, and I helped users with legacy Oracle Apex database web applications to work with the new Microsoft Edge on legacy Oracle Java version 6. These programs used Java to run their financial web applications. However, it has not been updated by the programmers to run the latest version of Java 22 since it is still running on Java 7.
For the Fiscal Operations Division, I contributed to the maintenance of legacy software there as well, addressing an outdated FoxPro application requiring continuous use for the financial reconciliation with CalSAWS. I engineered a 32-bit virtual machine (VM) solution to sustain the application, effectively supporting approximately eight computer systems. Subsequently, revisited the support process, reconstructing the virtual machines to enable seamless functionality on the Windows 32-bit platform with Windows OS version 21H2, following the network security issue faced with Windows version 1909.

I utilized Adobe Firefly for the generation of AI images tailored as desktop backgrounds for the newly updated virtual machines (VMs). This established a clear visual demarcation between physical and virtual computing environments.

I collaborated with the Principal Network Systems Administrator (PNSA) and key Information Technology Managers (ITM) to deliberate and strategize the implementation of the proposed solution. Through a series of constructive discussions and consultations, the decision was reached to adopt this interim approach until the migration of the FoxPro database to the platform, Oracle Apex database application is completed.

Assisting users in adding shared Outlook Calendars, shared mailboxes, resolve user issues with emails they suspect is phishing or trojan horses, helped to isolate or scan computer for any worms or malware and report back to the Departmental Information Security Office once completed. I also resolve simple user lock-out issues or complicated lock-outs related to user logging into multiple computers, fix desk scanner problems and maintenance of those scanners, and diagnose Microfiche machines for issues and determine if it could be repaired or needs replacement. 

With the recent recruitment of personnel, the HR department occasionally undertakes the verification of accounts to ascertain whether they have been system-generated. Previously, this was a manual procedure, but I devised a script utilizing PowerShell and DOS programming, which facilitates the automated verification of employee accounts.

Furthermore, I leveraged DOS programming for the implementation of new test links for examination workstations and the timely update of offline laptops with the most recent software installations, ensuring seamless operations. I have also developed additional DOS-based programs for tasks such as rebooting computer networks and updating Windows operating systems OS Installation with critical updates.

Also, conducted tasks of removal of older Microsoft Office versions for information security and network security reasons according to risk assessment provided by Network Systems Administrators. 

I helped test and resolve Plantronics wireless headsets and wired USB headsets and / or computer speakers for user communication on Microsoft Teams. I would replace or repair broken hardware components or simply update the firmware for the device. Additionally, I assisted with creating new shared mailbox requests and addressed various Outlook-related issues, including mailbox limits and archiving mail. I conduct network testing to ensure that a malfunctioning ethernet port is switched at the Catalyst, routinely help with reset of  Internet Protocol (IP) Phones so I am proficient in configuring and troubleshooting telecommunications equipment and systems. I assist users with Amazon Appstream issues usually due to a complex network infrastructure issue on the customer side with their Internet Service Provider (ISP).

During E-Discovery phases for attorneys, I conducted a risk assessment and finally assisted with securely providing documents electronically using encrypted compressed zip files or requesting access for Managed File Transfer Portal (MFT) for users. I also resolved Adobe Acrobat and other software-related issues, including Active Directory problems, and managed inventory, including ergonomic equipment installations. Assisted users with workflow analysis issues and provide recommendations.

I transferred to this location for Customer Service Center Operations (CSC Operations section) as an Eligibility Supervisor (ES) under the supervision of Maria Montoya, for the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS). However, I worked closely with Michelle Sepulveda, the division chief managing all the call centers.

This position was presented to me when they needed help to manage, coordinate, train, and monitor current and new staff at the five Customer Service Centers (CSC). The number of new staff hired was abundant yet not enough to help with the need for responding to the numerous daily calls from the public due to the pandemic; less staff were also not going to the offices, and lobbies were closed to the public. They offered me the position knowing my research skills, critical thinking, data analysis, analytical skills, problem solving skills, and strategic planning skills when they had seen that I had provided an extensive foundational system for the Intake Process on staff receiving calls for new applications. 

I demonstrated success in overseeing the implementation and support of critical systems to that project objective, ensuring seamless integration and minimizing downtime of our Customer Service Center. I helped with site assessments and helped to continue development of technical information systems and procedures that allowed for staff to work remotely from home under the guidance of the director of Customer Call Center (CSC). This allowed for more Eligibility staff to be hired and assigned to the CSCs increasing the workforce to help the community. 

Using data from other hubs such as Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (CUIC), I helped with the surveying and training of new staff to be work-ready or ready to take calls from customers. I was one of the main trainers to help with the new staff as I had developed most of the user manual and business procedures and had oversight of the technical aspect of the systems development. 

I assisted in creating different reports to better understand how staff's work habits affect the call center queues and to help retrain staff. These systems had been tested at my previous location, at CSC 4 and CSC 5; this made for easy adoption of these technical procedures to expand to the other three new offices CSC 6, 7, 8. I went onsite to conduct site assessments to ensure the success of the project as it was during the pandemic, and we wanted to ensure that everything works smoothly. I also prepared comprehensive analytical reports for management, highlighting key performance metrics and strategic insights.

I helped with the development systems to work even more efficiently from home for all Customer Service Centers (CSC) and not only “The End-to-End Project” (CSC IV and V). Other information systems I had helped create are other systems for Timekeepers, (Human Services Administrators) (HSA) Managers, Eligibility Supervisors (ES), and Eligibility Workers (EW). Helped users understand the digital signature function for all staff as no paper was being used at this time on the work at home initiative. With the advent of new information systems during the pandemic, it streamlined the information and handling of cases. Working with Salesforce contributed to reinventing the way to document cases as well. 

I participated in the discussions with the vendor and Information Technology (IT) teams for certain quality assurance functions with line staff, as well as working with Information Technology Managers (ITM) and Human Services Administrators (HSA) to ensure every role has the functionality to perform and complete their assignments. We had Microsoft Team meetings to discuss the information processing in the prototypes of the applications development phase. We gathered and discussed the technical specification of the Salesforce web application with the use of Cisco Finesse and eventually the final application development for Salesforce was released to the CSC’s for use. Collaborated with stakeholders to assess Information Systems requirements with Information Technology Managers (ITMs), Principal Application Developers, Senior Information System Analysts, and outside contractors also developers or business analysts from Salesforce.

I created an audit trail report using data from CalSAWS so that it can be easily analyzed showing user’s time spent on various webpages in CalSAWS. I also completed and compiled administrative reports such as Overtime budgeting reports, compiling comments from all managers at the CSC's, and Line Operations Development (LOD) for different policies that are to be released. I kept track of the COVID Daily Absence Reports and Public charge report to provide to central staff. I collaborated with Quality control from Management Information and Evaluation (MIE) of DPSS on gathering Semi-Annual Report (SAR 7) data for quality control evaluation. I helped gather information for the daily call volume from the previous day with Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (CUIC) and determined hourly, the number of calls with the number of staff available. This helped to advise for checking on staff availability and productivity. 

I also helped with the Staff Assistant on gatekeeping role, which was to assign different threshold language customers to available staff to shorten the queue wait times using Cisco Unified Intelligence Center, (CUIC). I had developed a system pulling data from the SQL database to quickly determine the availability of staff that can take calls in the different threshold languages. I was trained by a Cisco consultant for the use of the Calabrio Workforce Management System (WFM), this system allowed us to forecast or predict a more accurate minimum number of staff needed to be on the phones each day for the call center environment.

I also participated in another web application development called Current; it was to be implemented to the regular offices that are not call centers. At the end of my tenure, we had added three more CSC’s, making a grand total of eight call centers, and expansion may still be on the roadmap for the need for eligibility of welfare determinations. I was also responsible for providing updates to the Department of Public Social Services main webpage for the Customer Service Center pages. When an update is needed, it would be updated on the website and approved by an Application Developer.

As an Eligibility Supervisor (ES) under the supervision of Efrain Garcia, I transferred to this location for the End-to-End CalFresh Project for the Department of Public Social Services (DPSS). This new project presented new functions, which included the need to train a team of seven (7) Eligibility Workers (EW's) in a call center environment.

The goal of the project is to bring CalFresh (Food Stamps) benefits to the public and increase the participation rate with a Customer Service Call Center / Intake model. My team consisted of new employees and previously assigned EW's that had never conducted Intake Interviews with the public before or completed any type of training for the Intake application process.

I trained staff with prior experience as customer service representatives; their function was only to create tickets based on tasks for office staff and needed extensive training. I generated Cherwell tickets to report CalSAWS system issues, subsequently directing them to Information Systems Analysts. Following this, the analysts reach out to me for collaborative troubleshooting sessions, occasionally spanning multiple sessions. 

I also trained specifically how to utilize income data from the customers to correctly anticipate and calculate eligibility for CalFresh benefits within the CalSAWS / LRS system. I ensured staff knew how to use the LRS (LEADER Replacement System), which is a web application used to determine eligibility for various welfare benefits, of which some staff were not familiar with, since their job function was different when their function was Customer Service. I showed staff some workarounds for common technical glitches at the time of LRS and provided staff with tools on how to complete the whole workflow in an efficient manner.

I have also provided a template with drop-downs or menu to be completed and copied over to the LRS system’s notes, Journal Entry (Case Narrative/Notes). I led the creation of journal templates for both piloting programs at the time (CalFresh and Medi-Cal) in an easier-to-read format that captures required information from customers for the eligibility determination of benefits. I created a worksheet tool with Adobe Acrobat DC that was complimentary to the journal templates. The Adobe PDF worksheet also had readymade drop-downs and made staff confident in their work as it is in a way a step-by-step guide for their job function. I constantly updated the worksheet tool with revisions with input from staff as well as supervisors and managers. Everyone found the tool helpful and it was eventually acquired by the First Contact Resolution Team for further development.

The process of simpler and easier completion of tasks and assignments was much appreciated by management. I helped to complete a report at the end of the week for the End-to-End CalFresh Project for my Unit. I helped to compile the reports from the other 11 units on this project into a master file and provided it to the Line Operations Development section (LOD).

I retrieved information for staff on the SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements) web application. A request is sent through, and sometimes same day processed through the USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) website. I developed a system to keep track of these SAVE requests with a digital log and became an administrator for giving access to other SAVE Liaisons (ES’s) under my guidance.

When more staff was needed for the customer service center since the pandemic had arrived, I offered my technical expertise in assisting to transition staff to working remotely. With discussion of the project, I was the lead on this project, this required me to identify, define, and conduct a data requirements analysis within information systems and their impact on system functionality and usability. This also required User Acceptance Testing (UAT), this allowed for me to create the system from the data requirements and design testing to ensure that it performs well in real use cases from the end-users, small groups with some beta testers and then once a successful use, it was rolled out to the rest of the Customer service center, which at the time was around 13-15 teams or units. This resulted in the successful integration and acceptance  of this new paperless information system allowing for data accessibility even when end-users are not physically present in the office. The call center had emptied due to work from home or staff working remotely and this complied with the mandatory pandemic requirements at the time. Then, more staff were needed to help with the call queues.

I also helped with the development of information systems related to where supervisors could manage their team’s timesheets, shared with other buddy supervisors as well as the timekeepers and managers so that there could be a seamless transition with the payroll cutoff needing to be completed timely.

As an Eligibility Supervisor (ES) at South Special District office, I was responsible for supervising between 7-10 employees at any given time. Additionally, I held several other roles within the office, including serving as the District Office SAVE (Electronic Immigration Status Verification) Liaison and acting as the Backup Gate Keeper, which involved administering the web application known as LRS (LEADER Replacement System, currently referred to as CalSAWS).

One of my primary responsibilities was to submit timesheets for all staff in the unit, ensuring that time-off and vacation records were accurate. I also assisted the backup unit in submitting their timesheets. Each unit consisted of approximately eight workers. In addition to handling administrative tasks, I provided guidance and training to staff on using the LRS system, including troubleshooting cases. I observed Eligibility Workers (EW's) during participant interviews and offered advice to help improve their interviewing skills.

Furthermore, I played a crucial role in reviewing, approving, and sometimes rejecting cases for various public assistance programs, such as Calfresh, Medi-Cal (medical coverage), and General Relief (cash aid). I made necessary corrections to cases originating from EW's and provided worksheets and tools to help EW's work efficiently and assist clients. I also assisted in dealing with irate and agitated participants when the help of EW's was required.

I actively participated in meetings focused on quality control to reduce errors received from the State of California. Additionally, I conducted Unit Meetings to relay messages from management and review common errors made by EW's in the previous month.

In terms of administrative tasks, I generated reports for the Intake Section, tracking pending applications, overdue cases, and delinquent customer service tickets for both the Intake and Approved Sections. I was responsible for reassigning file caseloads for employees transferring between different units within the district office on the LRS system.

As the office's Gatekeeper, I created new worker IDs for incoming employees and assisted the GROW (General Relief Opportunity for Work) Section in setting up worker IDs for access to LRS. I worked with technical support to resolve issues related to the mobile printing system connected to the county Wi-Fi network.

I also had to contact ISD (Internal Services Department) to add specific Worker IDs for contracted employees of DPSS and request specialized access for software for Eligibility Supervisors (ES). To improve the quality and consistency of case narratives / notes, I contributed to the information systems development of applications, namely a system that creates better templates. For the User Testing Acceptance (UAT), I organized a competition among staff to encourage participation and creativity that resulted in the perfect templates. The winners received gift cards from management and their ideas were incorporated into the journal / narrative templates used by all users at the office.

Additionally, I compiled a monthly report for the Sheriff/DPSS Homeless Release Project, which involved interviewing recently released inmates who were homeless. I oversaw confidential cases flagged as Domestic Violence cases and assisted in creating a more efficient scheduling system for Intake Eligibility Workers based on the Round-Robin method.

I conducted attendance reviews to ensure staff compliance with the attendance policy and reviewed time-off requests, coordinate coverage as needed.

Eventually, I transferred to a different section related to SAR/QR (Semi Annual Reporting/Quarterly Reporting). This section faced productivity issues, leading to delays in benefit issuance. I assessed the situation and implemented a task-based system for completing SAR 7 reports. It was crucial to gain staff consensus to ensure successful implementation. I fostered a collaborative environment that instilled trust among the staff, resulting in improved productivity and the timely submission of Production Reports, satisfying both customers and management.

As an Eligibility Worker, my responsibilities included conducting interviews with potential participants to determine their eligibility for public assistance programs such as CalFresh, Medi-Cal, and General Relief. During these interviews, I collected financial and other eligibility data to assess the available assistance option for participants. I was also responsible for completing all the necessary documentation required for the approval, continuation, or re-evaluation of benefits.

In addition to processing paperwork, I played a crucial role in explaining the policies and provisions of various public assistance programs, as well as the legal and civil rights and responsibilities of participants. I approached my work with empathy, especially when dealing with participants who were disabled or in abusive relationships.

Another important aspect of my job involved advising participants about potential sanctions for non-compliance with the terms and conditions of their benefits. To make these determinations, I thoroughly reviewed and analyzed financial and eligibility information to either authorize initial eligibility or continue benefits for General Relief, CalFresh, and Medi-Cal recipients.

Furthermore, I frequently reached out to individuals, agencies, insurance companies, schools, and other relevant institutions to verify and resolve any discrepancies in the information provided by participants. My role also involved making recommendations for appropriate dispositions based on the available information.

Calculating benefits for eligible applicants or participants was part of my duties, and I had to determine whether funds could be authorized for special needs. I diligently updated program participants' financial information screens and documents to ensure the continued authorization of benefits.

Efficiency was a priority in my workflow. I organized my workload meticulously to minimize the time required to process cases. Assignments were prioritized to guarantee that case records and documents were filed, processed, verified, and updated within specific time limits, in compliance with the deadlines established by legislation and regulations.

Communication played a vital role in my role as well. I frequently made calls to interview participants, verify eligibility, and clarify any pertinent information related to a participant's case file, particularly in special cases. Additionally, I conducted preliminary assessments of applicants or program participants' social situations to identify potential problems and make appropriate referrals to social service staff or other agencies and organizations that could provide services and resources to address their immediate and long-term needs.

I also had responsibilities related to data management. I prepared the necessary forms for entering participants' financial and biographical data into the computer system. I reviewed computer-generated data reports to ensure accuracy and verified whether applicants or program participants were receiving income from other sources of public assistance or programs through systems like MEDS.

In the course of my work, I followed established criteria to identify suspected cases of welfare fraud, which were then referred to the Welfare Fraud Prevention and Investigations Unit.

Furthermore, I played a role to lead others in training newly hired employees for the General Relief, Calfresh, and Medi-Cal programs. I was also a member of the Electronic Documents Management System task force (EDMS), where we contributed to clearing a substantial number of bundled cases by scanning and uploading documents into the new LRS system.

I conduct case management and workflow analysis, identify more efficient ways to complete tasks and streamline the interview process. To assist my colleagues, I created systematic workflows for multiple tasks and documented them in a checklist format, which I distributed among coworkers. This standardized approach simplified various tasks and addressed software inefficiencies and limitations.

Moreover, I made personalized task recommendations for coworkers to better align with their specific needs and responsibilities, ultimately contributing to a smoother and more efficient work environment. My goal was to support my team in providing effective public assistance services to those in need.

As a Property Manager for Avantgarde LLC since June 2010, my responsibilities have been diverse and encompass a wide range of tasks, including those of a network administrator. I have overseen various aspects of the company's operations, including property management and sales, collaboration with loan officers, title and escrow processes, and interactions with attorneys.

My recent tasks have included lease management, tenant screening, and lease agreement generation. I have also been responsible for hiring contractors when necessary and even undertaking repairs for tenants in certain situations. To select the most suitable contractor, I have been involved in compiling quotes, considering pricing, ratings, and customer reviews, and sometimes meeting with local contractors.

Furthermore, I am responsible for completing the annual tax returns for the company. This includes providing income distribution forms to shareholders (Schedule K-1), issuing checks for federal and state taxes, and filing necessary documents such as the bi-annual Statement of Information (LLC-12) and filing of annual city Business License fees.

Facilitating rent payments through online services like electronic bank transfers (EFT), Zelle, Venmo, or monetary services has been part of my tenant accommodation responsibilities. In terms of property investment, I have participated in property renovation projects with various investors and partners, including our own residential property renovation. I have assisted homeowners and property owners facing mortgage difficulties or foreclosure, offering them different scenarios and options, along with recommendations and follow-up.

In addition to my property management duties, I play a crucial role in the network management systems and ensure that the company's information technology computer networking infrastructure remains up-to-date. This includes handling the completion of company’s day to day operations, taxes as well as serving as being the lead for our networks system administration, I helped with designing the updated network infrastructure for the company. Our enterprise grade gateway boasts a 2.5 Gbps data flow capacity and a 10 Gbps capacity network performance for the local area network (LAN), expected to remain in use for at least five more years with the current system configuration. We have a Gigabit Fiber-Optic Internet connection as the primary input, and there are discussions about expanding to wireless connection (WLAN) in the vicinity. 

I have overseen the maintenance of the mainframe server, housing connections to Network-attached storage (NAS) for resource allocation and serves as the company data center. And for future capacity planning we want to implement Storage Area Network (SAN) as more data  will be needed in the future role of artificial intelligence (AI) related systems such as databases for causal inference analysis. These information systems play a major role to the business architecture as we use it to manage data effectively in a centralized platform and to minimize downtime. We had determined more than a few years ago through network testing and insufficient security with just Wi-Fi (WLAN) use. Over a long period of testing plans and analysis, we opted for a full network upgrade. This infrastructure is expected to remain in use for the foreseeable future.
I have also managed multiple network IP cameras, managing network configuration to include a dedicated Network Video Recorder (NVR) storage on-site and off-site. Our network gateway incorporates a primary gigabit connection and resource utilization of a secondary backup gateway via 5G cellular network connection, serving as a failover and high-availability load balancing solution for heavy network usage. I installed an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) to ensure server data is save for about an hour during power outages allowing for server to be properly shutdown if required.

As a network administrator, I have personally installed and trained staff to install ethernet connection ports throughout the premises, totaling more than 20 ethernet connections and several Wi-Fi access points with guest access control. The enterprise environment ensures business continuity as the network is up-to-date and will not experience major issues related to the network. I manage Access Control Lists (ACL) to control user roles in terms of network security, with a backup network administrator for remote access. We utilize a company VPN with WireGuard for remote access to company resources for the privacy of company assets, and virtual networks (VLAN) are configured to control data flows for the separation of company and guest networks protecting both parties. I have implemented robust cybersecurity detection system that includes 35-point intrusion detection to protect against incoming threats and hacker attacks providing an audit trail. Additionally, I administer access permissions for different data lines and security cameras, both on-site and off-site. Users are trained to use company resources in a proper manner that does not endanger company resources.

Other responsibilities include the research and installation of network devices, including wireless access points and ensuring optimal Wi-Fi coverage without dead zones. Power over Ethernet (PoE) is used for wireless access points, and server maintenance and access are conducted regularly with my team. I handle the procurement of yearly anti-virus software for security, mainly for two operating systems, Mac OS and Windows 10 and oversee critical updates and patches Upgrading existing equipment when necessary, such as adding physical RAM memory, is part of my role. I have also been involved in setting up computer office furniture, printers, and scanners. Mobile devices, like mobile phones, have been employed for scanning documents using apps like Adobe Scan. We installed air purifiers on the premises due to the pandemic.

Over the years, we have made many system enhancements and with the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated and easy to use, enabling small companies to quickly learn and engage in application development with data that we gather from the property market data. It enabled us to determine if we should pursue a property or if a tenant is risky not only based on credit factors but with a database management system. We collaborated with key stakeholders to identify some potential risks of this adoption of new information systems, devising initiative change management plans to mitigate any adverse impacts on our business processes and ensure a smooth transition as more of our data is now computerized with this new era. The old way of just simple Excel databases and manual data compilation and comparison are no longer used.

In addition, the integration of customer relationship management (CRM) tools within these new information systems provide us with swift access to tenant and prospective customer data. We implemented thorough unit testing procedures, including testing an API from OpenAPI with a property database, which significantly enhanced our productivity and reduced the time needed for property prospecting. 

This experimental approach allowed for this new perspective in database management and further research AI use cases using True Root Cause Analysis (TRCA), we are able to clearly define some known issues with some inefficiencies for business applications such as reducing tenant complaints and minimizing maintenance issues, we gathered relevant data, map out the contributing factors and relations between data elements, analyze the data and information to determine the primary reasons for a problem, validate the root cause with the evidence and data gathered to ensure its accuracy; with action planning, develop a plan to address the root causes effectively, and finally implement and monitor the planned action for overtime effectiveness to ensure the problem does not resurface. 

Outside of my property management and IT responsibilities, I have collaborated with overseas mobile game developers based in Kyiv, Ukraine. First, we discussed the project scope which included the requirements, the timeline, and the protocol for implementing change  requests with the change management system implemented in Elance, we discussed the milestones and the deliverables, which was the final end product, the mobile game application. We explored Swift programming language for the game development to create a game for the Apple App Store and successfully launched an iPhone game, this project involved me to coordinate with developers, graphic designers, and programmers for the program and systems design, testing, and simulation of the beta versions. At the end, they provided the technical documents and source code for uploading to the App Store, finally resulting in a working application. 

In summary, my role as a Property Manager for Avantgarde LLC has encompassed a wide array of responsibilities, including property management, IT infrastructure management, property investment, network design and administration, security, procurement, tax compliance, and even collaboration on a game development project. These diverse tasks have provided me with a broad skill set and valuable experience in multiple domains.
