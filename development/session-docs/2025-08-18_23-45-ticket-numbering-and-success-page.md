```
ITTS_Region7 → R7-250818-001, R7-250818-002
NET_North    → NN-250818-001, NN-250818-002  
DEV_Alpha    → DA-250818-001, DA-250818-002
SEC_Core     → SC-250818-001, SC-250818-002
```

- 📧 Auto-opens email client then redirects to success page
- 🔄 Clean form reset with proper team assignment
- 💼 Business context awareness for estimates

## 📂 **Files Created/Modified**

### **New Files:**
1. `/lib/ticket-numbering.ts` - Core numbering system with team prefix mapping
2. `/app/public-portal/success/page.tsx` - Animated success page

### **Modified Files:**
1. `/lib/database.ts` - Added ticket sequences table initialization
2. `/app/api/tickets/route.ts` - Updated to use new numbering system
3. `/app/public-portal/page.tsx` - Updated submission flow for success redirect
4. `/server/database.js` - Updated all sample data with new team references

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ticket_sequences (
  team_id TEXT,
  date TEXT,
  last_sequence INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  prefix TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (team_id, date)
);
```

### **Team Prefix Mapping:**
```javascript
const teamPrefixes = {
  'ITTS_Region7': 'R7',
  'NET_North': 'NN',
  'DEV_Alpha': 'DA',
  'SEC_Core': 'SC'
  // Auto-generates if not mapped
};
```

### **Animation Libraries Used:**
- Framer Motion for complex animations
- Lucide React for icons (Sparkles, CheckCircle)
- Tailwind CSS for styling and transitions

## 🚀 **User Experience Flow**

1. **Submission** → User submits ticket via public portal
2. **Email Opens** → `mailto:` link opens with pre-filled content
3. **Redirect** → After 1 second, redirects to success page
4. **Celebration** → Animated success page with confirmation number
5. **Actions** → Submit another ticket or return home

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Email Functionality:**
- Currently uses `mailto:` links (opens user's email client)
- User must manually click "Send" in their email app
- **Future enhancement**: Implement server-side email sending (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)

### **Team Structure Updates:**
- All references changed from `ITTS_Main` to `ITTS_Region7` 
- Support team structure organized under "ITTS: Region 7" header
- Form uses `Crossroads_Main` as value, routes to `ITTS_Region7` team_id

### **Migration Strategy:**
- One-time automatic migration of existing tickets
- Graceful handling of duplicate column errors
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

## 🔮 **Identified Future Enhancements**

1. **Real Email Sending**
   - Implement server-side email with SendGrid/Resend
   - Send confirmation emails to users
   - Send notification emails to IT support teams

2. **Enhanced Animations**
   - Add sound effects for submission success
   - Implement progress indicators for form submission
   - Create loading animations between steps

3. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track ticket submission success rates
   - Monitor response time accuracy
   - Analyze team workload distribution

## 🛠️ **Session End State**

- ✅ **Server restart required** to see new ticket numbering
- ✅ **Database automatically migrates** existing tickets on first run
- ✅ **All forms functional** with new team-based routing
- ✅ **Success page fully animated** and responsive
- ✅ **Ready for testing** and user feedback

## 📋 **Next Session Priorities**
